IU Paged Media is a repository for works that exist primarily as bundles 
of page images -- scans of physical documents, for example.  Pages can 
be organized into sections, volumes, etc.  One may leaf through a paged 
object as with a physical book, or visually navigate the hierarchial 
structure of a work or a collection of works.

Paged Media defines a general ingestion format and comes with several 
formatters which transform existing export formats for ingestion.

## Futures

There has been considerable discussion of adding a machine-readable 
transcript layer to support full-text searching and highlighting, 
and additional navigation layers for specialized forms such as 
newspapers.

## Setup
